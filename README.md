# How to make your Skeleton Buddy perform dance moves using JavaScript || GeekStar Codes

I always wondered if I could make a skeleton shaped object perform certain dance moves using JavaScript. It was neither an easy task nor difficult. With the help of “toxiclibsjs” and “p5.js” it became easier to generate this animation. I had fun creating this. You can also play with the code by changing certain values for changes in the skeleton’s shape, size, color, behavior, etc. You can even make it more Spooky. 💀
